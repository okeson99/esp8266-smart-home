Board Model: NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
Built-in LED: GPIO2 (D4) — Active LOW
What i learnt: Downlaod of the board model was quick and fast.
i also connected the board on COM 9(USB Port) and it was detated by the Arduino app
the line of code was successful, as the LED light started blicking SOS immediately the Build Up was complete
